## Coding Standards

### Python Style Guide

Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guidelines:

- Use 4 spaces for indentation (no tabs)
- Maximum line length: 100 characters
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Add docstrings to all functions, classes, and modules
- Use type hints where appropriate

**Example:**
```python
def calculate_productive_time(start_time: datetime, end_time: datetime) -> int:
    """
    Calculate productive work time in minutes.
    
    Args:
        start_time: Start of work session
        end_time: End of work session
        
    Returns:
        Productive time in minutes
    """
    delta = end_time - start_time
    return int(delta.total_seconds() / 60)
```

### Code Organization

- Keep functions focused and single-purpose
- Limit function complexity (max 15-20 lines recommended)
- Use meaningful comments for complex logic
- Organize imports: standard library, third-party, local
- Avoid circular dependencies

### GUI Guidelines

- Follow existing UI patterns and conventions
- Maintain consistent spacing and alignment
- Provide user feedback for all actions
- Handle errors gracefully with user-friendly messages
- Support keyboard shortcuts where applicable

## Testing Guidelines

### Writing Tests

- Write tests for new features and bug fixes
- Aim for high test coverage (minimum 70%)
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Use descriptive test names

**Example:**
```python
def test_calculate_overtime_positive():
    """Test overtime calculation when work exceeds norm."""
    work_minutes = 480  # 8 hours
    result = calculate_overtime(work_minutes, work_norm=450)
    assert result == 30
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
python -m pytest tests/

# Run specific test file
python -m pytest tests/test_time_calculator.py

# Run with coverage
python -m pytest --cov=. tests/
```
